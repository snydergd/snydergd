## Synopsis
⛏️🧑‍💻️ An explorer/navigator of technical realms. 🧑‍💻️⛏️

## Personality
- ❓ I am never afraid to look stupid by asking a stupid question.
- 🍻 I am friendly.  No matter the topic, I always try and make the other people involved feel comfortable and welcome.  I like to help people.
- 🚊 I love to be challenged/questioned - this is how we find agreement and learn!  I believe that I should always be able to make a strong case for my stance and change it when there's new information.
- ☮️ I can never hold a grudge.  I think caring makes people better more than anything else, and that it's true that "love conquers all".  We are all just humans trying to do our best with the time we have.

## Some things I've learned
- ⛏️ Just because a solution works doesn't make it the right one - consider all the factors to avoid a maintenance nightmare
- 📓 The most important part of finding a solution is understanding the problem fully
- 🙂 Every tool you use has its own cost - keep things simple
