## Personal Philosophy
- It's a waste of time to build a treehouse like a skyscraper -- you need to know what you're building at the start.
- A deep understanding of a thing is necessary before you can improve it.
- Shiny solutions make it easy to get blinded to what they don't have.

## Some things I would love to do more with
- GraphQL
- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, knowledge graphs, semantic web
- IPFS
- No-Code applications (have not found a good solution but believe it is possible and worth investigating)
- Rust
